1. The no of bits to be flapped= no of diff bits
2. The no of 1's in a^b will be the ans
3. To count no of 1's , diff&1 and diff>>1

Time:O(log2(n)). Space:O(1)

int countBitsFlip(int a, int b){
        
        // Your logic here
        
        //xor returns 1 if there are diff bits
        int diff= a ^ b;
        
        //now count no of 1's in this
        
        int counter=0;
        while(diff)
        {
            if(diff & 1==1)
            {
                counter++;
            }
            diff=diff>>1;
        }
        
        return counter;
