1. Since every number except the ans occurs three times, if we exclude the ans and keep remaining nos, all bits will have set bits as multiple of 3 as every
no occurs thrice.
2. Now if we add the number and count set bits at every posistion, the bit where set bit count%3!=0 means this has a set bit there, else means this ans
has 0 there.
3. Keep traversing all bits and adding set bit of ans.

        {

            int temp=1<<i;
            
            for(int j=0;j<n;j++)
