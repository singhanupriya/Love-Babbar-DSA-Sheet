N – Maximum unit of food you can buy each day.
S – Number of days you are required to survive.
M – Unit of food required each day to survive.

1. Total food u require to survive for S days= S*M;
2. Number of sunday=S/7;
3. No of days u are allowed to buy=S- no of sundays.
4. Keep buying the max unit of food each day till u no longer require food, count the no of days needs for this.
5. If this is greater than the no of days u are allowed to buy, not possible else return no of days.

Time:O(S*M), Space:O(1)


int minimumDays(int S, int N, int M){
        // code here
        
        int noOfSundays=S/7;
        int daysAllowedToBuy=S-noOfSundays;
        
        
        //total food reqd to survive S days when u need M food per day
        int totalFoodRequired=S*M;
        
        int days=0;
        
        //keep buying the food per day till u no more require to buy food
        while(totalFoodRequired > 0)
        {
            totalFoodRequired=totalFoodRequired-N;  //buy max allowed on first day
            days++;
        }
        
        //if no of days u are buying > days allowed not possible
        if(days > daysAllowedToBuy)
        {
            return -1;
        }
        return days;
