1. Sort the arry in increasing order of price.
2. For min price- buy the cheapest product and from that buy k most exp products, buy second cheapest prod and buy k next most exp, keep doing until all candies and bought.
3. For max price- buy the most expensive product and from that buy k cheapest products, buy second most exp prod and buy k next cheapest, keep doing until all candies and bought.
4. Use 2 pointers for array traversal.

Time:O(n log n + n)
Space:O(1)


vector<int> candyStore(int arr[], int N, int k)
    {
        // Write Your Code here
        
        vector<int> ans;
        if(N==0)
        {
            return ans;
        }
        
        sort(arr,arr+N);
        
        //minimum price
        int minPrice=0;
        int i=0,j=N-1;
        while(i<=j)
        {
            minPrice+=arr[i];
            j=j-k;
            i++;
        }
        
        
        //max price
        int maxPrice=0;
        i=0,j=N-1;
        while(i<=j)
        {
            maxPrice+=arr[j];
            i=i+k;
            j--;
        }
        
        ans.push_back(minPrice);
        ans.push_back(maxPrice);
        return ans;
    }
