Logic - we know the diff between adj elements is 1, find diff of first element from x, from ur current index u will have to move i=i+abs(x-arr[i]), if i>n , not found
Time:O(N), Space:O(1)

int search(int arr[], int n, int x, int k)
{
    // Complete the function
    
    int i=0;
    while(i<n)
    {
        if(arr[i]==x)
        {
            return i;
            
            
        }
        i=i + abs(x-arr[i]);
    }
    
    return -1;
}    


q2- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/searching-array-adjacent-differ-k/

adj diff is atmost k, similar logic u will have to move atleast abs(arr[i]-x)/k steps, here the diff can be 0 as well, u dont want to keep checking the same element so here 
i=i+max(1,abs(arr[i]-x)/diff) so that i moves ahead, if i>n, not found.

int search(int arr[], int n, int x, int k)
{
    // Complete the function
    
    int i=0;
    while(i<n)
    {
        if(arr[i]==x)
        {
            return i;
            
            
        }
        i=i + max(1,abs(x-arr[i])/k);
    }
    
    return -1;
}
