Criteria for analysis for sorting algorithms:

1. Time Complexity
2. Space Complexity -> Inplace sorting algo (if constant space)
3. Stability -> If the order of elements which occur more than once remains same in the sorted array.
4. Internal Sorting algo -> All data is loaded into the memory
5. External Sorting algo -> All data is not loaded into the memory
6. Adaptive -> Already sorted data takes less time.
7. Recursive/Non-recursive
